# Fixture data for wger
Repository with some fixture data too big to check in the main app. At the
moment, this is only the ingredient fixture.

Uses [Github's LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files),
install the extension first if you don't see any files after cloning.
